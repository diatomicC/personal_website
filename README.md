# Details

This personal website is designed to be an interactive, responsive, and visually appealing platform to showcase the user's personal information, projects, courses, and relevant links. Below is a detailed description of the features and functions of the website.

## Responsive Design

The website has been designed to adapt to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices. This is achieved using media queries in the CSS file, which adjust the layout, font sizes, and element positioning based on the device's screen width.

## Interactive Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is a key feature of the website, allowing users to quickly and easily navigate between different sections of the site. It consists of a horizontal list of links that smoothly transition to a mobile-friendly, collapsible menu on smaller screens. The navigation bar is also sticky, remaining at the top of the page as the user scrolls.

## Image Hover Effect

The website includes an image hover effect, which adds an interactive element to the site's visuals. When the user hovers over an image, the image's grayscale filter is removed, revealing the original, full-color version. This effect is implemented using CSS transitions and filters.

## Slideshow

A slideshow with autoplay functionality has been integrated into the website, allowing users to showcase a series of images or projects. The slideshow automatically cycles through the images with a smooth transition effect. This feature is implemented using JavaScript and CSS animations.

## Dynamic Content Sections

The website contains several content sections, including About, Courses, Links, and more. Each section is designed to be easily customizable, allowing users to showcase their personal experiences, achievements, and interests. These sections are implemented using a combination of HTML and CSS.

### About Section

The About section provides a brief introduction to the user, including personal information, interests, and a profile picture. This section utilizes a flexbox layout to ensure proper alignment and responsiveness on various screen sizes.

### Courses Section

The Courses section displays a table of courses the user has taken, complete with course names and descriptions. The table is styled using CSS and features a hover effect that highlights rows when the user hovers over them.

### Links Section

The Links section contains a list of relevant external links, such as the user's social media profiles, portfolio, or blog. The links are styled with CSS to ensure a clean and visually appealing presentation.

## Progress Bar on Scroll

As users scroll through the website, a progress bar at the top of the page fills up to indicate their current position on the site. This feature is implemented using JavaScript to track the user's scroll position and update the progress bar accordingly.

## Comment and Email Submission Form

The website includes a comment and email submission form, allowing users to provide feedback or get in touch with the website owner. The form features input validation and is styled with CSS to ensure a consistent and visually appealing design.

## Customizable Color Schemes

The website has been designed with a customizable color scheme, allowing users to easily modify the appearance of the site to match their personal preferences or branding. The color scheme is defined using CSS variables, which can be updated to change the site's colors globally.
